# 🛡️ Advanced Content Moderation Assistant

The **Advanced Content Moderation Assistant** is a lightweight, fast, and fully client-side moderation tool built using **Vite, React, ShadCN/UI, and TypeScript**.  
It detects inappropriate or offensive language using a **custom-built slang dictionary** — without relying on external APIs, datasets, or cloud services.
